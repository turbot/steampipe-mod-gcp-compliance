## Description

BigQuery by default encrypts the data as rest by employing `Envelope Encryption` using Google managed cryptographic keys. The data is encrypted using the data encryption keys and `data encryption keys` themselves are further encrypted using key encryption keys. This is seamless and do not require any additional input from the user. However, if you want to have greater control, Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) can be used as encryption key management solution for BigQuery Data Sets.

## Rationale

BigQuery by default encrypts the data as rest by employing Envelope Encryption using Google managed cryptographic keys. This is seamless and does not require any additional input from the user.

For greater control over the encryption, customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) can be used as encryption key management solution for BigQuery Data Sets. Setting a Default Customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) for a data set ensure any tables created in future will use the specified CMEK if none other is provided.

## Remediation

The default CMEK for existing data sets can be updated by specifying the default key in the `EncryptionConfiguration.kmsKeyName` field when calling the `datasets.insert` or `datasets.patch` methods

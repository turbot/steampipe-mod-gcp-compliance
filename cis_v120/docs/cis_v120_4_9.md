## Description

Compute instances should not be configured to have external IP addresses.

## Rationale

To reduce your attack surface, Compute instances should not have public IP addresses. Instead, instances should be configured behind load balancers, to minimize the instance's exposure to the internet.

## Remediation

To be able turn on Shielded VM on an instance, your instance must use an image with Shielded VM support.

## From Console

1. Login to [VM instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances).
2. Click on the instance name to see its VM instance details page.
3. Click **EDIT**
4. For each `Network interface`, ensure that `External IP` is set to `None`.
5. Click Done and then click Save.

## From Command Line


1. Describe the instance properties:

```bash
gcloud compute instances describe INSTANCE_NAME --zone=ZONE
```

2. Identify the access config name that contains the external IP address. This access config appears in the following format:

```
networkInterfaces:
- accessConfigs:
- kind: compute#accessConfig
  name: External NAT
  natIP: 130.211.181.55
  type: ONE_TO_ONE_NAT
```

3. Delete the access config.

```bash
gcloud compute instances update INSTANCE_NAME --shielded-vm-secure-boot
```

4. Restart the instance:

```bash
gcloud compute instances delete-access-config INSTANCE_NAME --zone=ZONE --access-config-name "ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME"
```

**Note:** In the above example, the ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME is External NAT. The name of your access config might be different.

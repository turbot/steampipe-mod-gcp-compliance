## Description

It is recommended to configure Second Generation Sql instance to use private IPs instead of public IPs.

## Rationale

To lower the organization's attack surface, Cloud SQL databases should not have public IPs. Private IPs provide improved network security and lower latency for your application.

## Remediation

This recommendation is applicable for Postgresql, MySql generation 1, MySql generation 2 and SQL Server 2017 instances.

## From Console

1. Login in to [Cloud SQL Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances)
2. Select the SQL Server instance to open details page.
3. Select the `Connections` tab.
4. Deselect the **Public IP** checkbox.
5. Click Save to update the instance.

## From Command Line

1. For every instance remove its public IP and assign a private IP instead:

```bash
gcloud beta sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME --network=VPC_NETWOR_NAME --noassign-ip
```

2. Confirm the changes using the following command:

```sql
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME
```

**Note:** By default, Cloud Sql instances have a public IP.

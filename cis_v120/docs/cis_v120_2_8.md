## Description

It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for *Virtual Private Cloud* (VPC) network route changes.

## Rationale

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) routes define the paths network traffic takes from a VM instance to another destination. The other destination can be inside the organization VPC network (such as another VM) or outside of it. Every route consists of a destination and a next hop. Traffic whose destination IP is within the destination range is sent to the next hop for delivery.

Monitoring changes to route tables will help ensure that all VPC traffic flows through an expected path.

## Remediation

### From Console

Create a required log metric:

1. Login to GCP console and navigate to [Logs-based Metrics](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics).
2. Click **CREATE METRIC**.
3. Select `Metric Type` as `Counter`, enter `Log metric name` and `Units` to 1.
4. Clear any text in the `Build filter` field and add below text
```
resource.type="gce_route"
AND protoPayload.methodName="beta.compute.routes.patch" OR protoPayload.methodName="beta.compute.routes.insert"
```
5. Click **CREATE METRIC**. The logs display based on the filter text entered by the user.

Create a required alert policy for the log metric::

1. Identify the newly created metric under the section [User-defined Metrics](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics).
2. Click the 3-dot icon in the right most column for the desired metric and select **Create alert from metric**. A new page opens.
3. Fill out the alert policy configuration and click Save. Choose the alerting threshold and configuration that makes sense for the user's organization. For example, a threshold of zero(0) for the most recent value will ensure that a notification is triggered for every owner change in the project.
4. Configure the desired notifications channels in the section Notifications.
5. Enter `Alert name` and click **Save**.

### From Command Line

Create a required log metric:
   - Use the command: gcloud beta logging metrics create.
   - Reference for [Command Usage](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/logging/metrics/create).

Create a alert policy for the log metric:
   - Use the command: gcloud alpha monitoring policies create.
   - Reference for [Command Usage](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/alpha/monitoring/policies/create).

## Description

In order to maintain the highest level of security all connections to an application should be secure by default.

## Rationale

Insecure HTTP connections maybe subject to eavesdropping which can expose sensitive data.

## Remediation

Add a line to the app.yaml file controlling the application which enforces secure connections. For example

```
handlers:
- url: /.*
  **secure: always**
  redirect_http_response_code: 301
  script: auto
```

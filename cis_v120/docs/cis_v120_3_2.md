## Description

In order to prevent use of legacy networks, a project should not have a legacy network configured.

Legacy networks have a single network IPv4 prefix range and a single gateway IP address for the whole network. The network is global in scope and spans all cloud regions. Subnetworks cannot be created in a legacy network and are unable to switch from legacy to auto or custom subnet networks. Legacy networks can have an impact for high network traffic projects and are subject to a single point of contention or failure.

## Remediation

For each Google Cloud Platform project,

1. Follow the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-legacy#creating_a_legacy_network) and create a non-legacy network suitable for the organization's requirements.
2. Follow the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-legacy#deleting_a_legacy_network) and delete the networks in the legacy mode.

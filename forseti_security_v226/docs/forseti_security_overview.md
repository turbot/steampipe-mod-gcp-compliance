## Overview

[Forseti Security](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/policy-library/blob/master/docs/bundles/forseti-security.md) is a collection of community-driven, open-source tools to help you improve the security of your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environments. Forseti consists of core modules that you can enable, configure, and execute independently of each other. Community contributors are also developing add-on modules to offer unique capabilities. Forsetiâ€™s core modules work together, and provide a foundation that others can build upon.

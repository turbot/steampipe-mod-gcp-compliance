## Overview

The [CFT Scorecard](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit/blob/master/cli/docs/scorecard.md) can be used to print a scorecard of your GCP environment, for resources and IAM policies in Cloud Asset Inventory (CAI) exports.
The policies tested are based on constraints and constraint templates from the [Config Validator policy library](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/policy-library/blob/master/docs/bundles/scorecard-v1.md).

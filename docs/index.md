[GCP](https://cloud.google.com) provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to authenticated customers on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

[CFT Scorecard](https://cloud.google.com/foundation-toolkit/) provides a set of security best-practice checks to detect misconfigurations and violations in Google Cloud resources and projects.

[CIS GCP Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/google_cloud_computing_platform/) provide a predefined set of compliance and security best-practice checks for GCP projects.

[Forseti Security Benchmark](https://forsetisecurity.org/docs/latest/concepts/best-practices.html) provides a set of security best practice checks for GCP projects so that you can take action to secure resources and minimize security risks.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[Steampipe Mods](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources#mod) are collections of `named queries`, and codified `controls` that can be used to test current configuration of your cloud resources against a desired configuration.

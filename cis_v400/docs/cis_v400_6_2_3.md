## Description

Enabling the `log_disconnections` setting logs the end of each session, including the session duration.

PostgreSQL does not log session details such as duration and session end by default. Enabling the `log_disconnections` setting will create log entries at the end of each session which can be useful in troubleshooting issues and determine any unusual activity across a time period. The `log_disconnections` and `log_connections` work hand in hand and generally, the pair would be enabled/disabled together. This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Go to the Cloud SQL Instances page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting [https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances).
2. Select the PostgreSQL instance where the database flag needs to be enabled.
3. Click `Edit`.
4. Scroll down to the `Flags` section.
5. To set a flag that has not been set on the instance before, click `Add a Database Flag`, choose the flag `log_disconnections` from the drop-down menu and set the value as `on`.
6. Click `Save`.
7. Confirm the changes under `Flags` on the Overview page.

### From Command Line

1. Configure the `log_disconnections` database flag for every Cloud SQL PosgreSQL database instance using the below command:

```bash
gcloud sql instances patch <INSTANCE_NAME> --database-flags log_disconnections=on
```

**Note**: This command will overwrite all previously setdatabase flags. To keep those and add new ones, include the values for all flags to be set on the instance; any flag not specifically included is set to its default value. For flags that do not take a value, specify the flag name followed by an equals sign ("=").

### Default Value

By default `log_disconnections` is off.

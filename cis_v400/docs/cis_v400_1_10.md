## Description

Google Cloud Key Management Service stores cryptographic keys in a hierarchical structure designed for useful and elegant access control management. The format for the rotation schedule depends on the client library that is used. For the gcloud command-line tool, the next rotation time must be in `ISO` or `RFC3339` format, and the rotation period must be in the form `INTEGER[UNIT]`, where units can be one of seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h) or days (d).

Set a key rotation period and starting time. A key can be created with a specified `rotation period`, which is the time between when new key versions are generated automatically. A key can also be created with a specified next rotation time. A key is a named object representing a `cryptographic` key used for a specific purpose. The key material, the actual bits used for `encryption`, can change over time as new key versions are created.

A key is used to protect some `corpus of data`. A collection of files could be encrypted with the same key and people with `decrypt` permissions on that key would be able to decrypt those files. Therefore, it's necessary to make sure the `rotation period` is set to a specific time.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Go to `Cryptographic Keys` by visiting: [https://console.cloud.google.com/security/kms](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/kms).
2. Click on the specific key ring.
3. From the list of keys, choose the specific key and Click on `Right side pop up the blade (3 dots)`.
4. Click on `Edit rotation period`.
5. On the pop-up window, `Select a new rotation period` in days which should be less than 90 and then choose `Starting on` date (date from which the rotation period begins).

### From Command Line

1. Update and schedule rotation by ROTATION_PERIOD and NEXT_ROTATION_TIME for each key:

```bash
gcloud kms keys update new --keyring=KEY_RING --location=LOCATION --next-rotation-time=NEXT_ROTATION_TIME --rotation-period=ROTATION_PERIOD
```

### Default Value

By default, KMS encryption keys are rotated every 90 days.

## Description

Database Server should accept connections only from trusted Network(s)/IP(s) and restrict access from the world.

To minimize attack surface on a Database server instance, only trusted/known and required IP(s) should be white-listed to connect to it.

An authorized network should not have IPs/networks configured to `0.0.0.0/0` which will allow access to the instance from anywhere in the world. Note that authorized networks apply only to instances with public IPs.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Go to the Cloud SQL Instances page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting [https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances).
2. Click the instance name to open its `Instance details` page.
3. Under the `Configuration` section click `Edit configurations`.
4. Under `Configuration options` expand the `Connectivity` section.
5. Click the `delete` icon for the authorized network `0.0.0.0/0`.
6. Click `Save` to update the instance.

### From Command Line

Update the authorized network list by dropping off any addresses

```bash
gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME --authorizednetworks=IP_ADDR1,IP_ADDR2,...
```

### Prevention

To prevent new SQL instances from being configured to accept incoming connections from any IP addresses, set up a `Restrict Authorized Networks on Cloud SQL instances` Organization Policy at: [https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/sql-restrictAuthorizedNetworks](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/sql-restrictAuthorizedNetworks).

### Default Value

By default, authorized networks are not configured. Remote connection to Cloud SQL database instance is not possible unless authorized networks are configured.

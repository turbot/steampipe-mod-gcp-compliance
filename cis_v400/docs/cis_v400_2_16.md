## Description

Logging enabled on a HTTPS Load Balancer will show all network traffic and its destination.

Logging will allow you to view HTTPS network traffic to your web applications.

## Remediation

### From Google Cloud Console

1. From Google Cloud home open the Navigation Menu in the top left.

1. Under the `Networking` heading select `Network services`.

1. Select the HTTPS load-balancer you wish to audit.

1. Select `Edit` then `Backend Configuration`.

1. Select `Edit` on the corresponding backend service.

1. Click `Enable Logging`.

1. Set `Sample Rate` to a desired value. This is a percentage as a decimal point. 1.0 is 100%.

### From Google Cloud CLI

1. Run the following command.

```bash
gcloud compute backend-services update <serviceName> --region=REGION --enable-logging --logging-sample-rate=<percentageAsADecimal>
```

### Default Value

By default logging for https load balancing is disabled. When logging is enabled it sets the default sample rate as 1.0 or 100%. Ensure this value fits the need of your organization to avoid high storage costs.

## Description

It is recommended to set `cross db ownership chaining` database flag for Cloud SQL SQL Server instance to `off`.

Use the `cross db ownership` for chaining option to configure cross-database ownership chaining for an instance of Microsoft SQL Server. This server option allows you to control cross-database ownership chaining at the database level or to allow cross-database ownership chaining for all databases.Enabling `cross db ownership` is not recommended unless all of the databases hosted by the instance of SQL Server must participate in crossdatabase ownership chaining and you are aware of the security implications of this setting.This recommendation is applicable to SQL Server database instances.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Go to the Cloud SQL Instances page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting [https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances).
2. Select the SQL Server instance for which you want to enable to database flag.
3. Click `Edit`.
4. Scroll down to the `Flags` section.
5. To set a flag that has not been set on the instance before, click `Add item`, choose the flag `cross db ownership chaining` from the drop-down menu, and set its value to `off`.
6. Click `Save`.
7. Confirm the changes under `Flags` on the Overview page.

**Note:** Any changes to the database flag values, may require your instance to be restarted

### From Command Line

1. Configure the the `cross db ownership chaining` database flag for every Cloud SQL SQL Server database instance using the below command.

```bash
gcloud sql instances patch <INSTANCE_NAME> --database-flags "cross db ownership chaining=off"
```

**Note**: This command will overwrite all database flags previously set. To keep those and add new ones, include the values for all flags you want set on the instance; any flag not specifically included is set to its default value. For flags that do not take a value, specify the flag name followed by an equals sign ("=").

### Default Value

As you have to manually turn on this flag, the default value for this is 'On'. Though you would have had to design your database schema from the start to include this feature, it often is not enabled.

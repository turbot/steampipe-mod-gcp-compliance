## Description

GCP Access Transparency provides audit logs for all actions that Google personnel take in your Google Cloud resources.

Controlling access to your information is one of the foundations of information security. Given that Google Employees do have access to your organizations' projects for support reasons, you should have logging in place to view who, when, and why your information is being accessed.

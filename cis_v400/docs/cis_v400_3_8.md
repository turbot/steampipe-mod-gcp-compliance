## Description

Flow Logs is a feature that enables users to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in the organization's VPC Subnets. Once a flow log is created, the user can view and retrieve its data in Stackdriver Logging. It is recommended that Flow Logs be enabled for every business-critical VPC subnet.

VPC networks and subnetworks not reserved for internal HTTP(S) load balancing provide logically isolated and secure network partitions where GCP resources can be launched. When Flow Logs are enabled for a subnet, VMs within that subnet start reporting on all Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows. Each VM samples the TCP and UDP flows it sees, inbound and outbound, whether the flow is to or from another VM, a host in the on-premises datacenter, a Google service, or a host on the Internet. If two GCP VMs are communicating, and both are in subnets that have VPC Flow Logs enabled, both VMs report the flows.

Flow Logs supports the following use cases:
- Network monitoring
- Understanding network usage and optimizing network traffic expenses
- Network forensics
- Real-time security analysis

Flow Logs provide visibility into network traffic for each VM inside the subnet and can be used to detect anomalous traffic or provide insight during security workflows.

The Flow Logs must be configured such that all network traffic is logged, the interval of logging is granular to provide detailed information on the connections, no logs are filtered, and metadata to facilitate investigations are included.

**Note**: Subnets reserved for use by internal HTTP(S) load balancers do not support VPC flow logs.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Go to the VPC network GCP Console visiting [https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/networks/list](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/networks/list).
2. Click the name of a subnet, The `Subnet details` page displays.
3. Click the `EDIT` button.
4. Set `Flow Logs` to `On`.
5. Expand the `Configure Logs` section.
6. Set `Aggregation Interval` to `5 SEC`.
7. Check the box beside `Include metadata`.
8. Set `Sample rate` to `100`.
9. Click Save.

**Note**: It is not possible to configure a Log filter from the console.

### From Command Line

To enable VPC Flow Logs for a network subnet, run the following command:

```bash
gcloud compute networks subnets update [SUBNET_NAME] --region [REGION] --enable-flow-logs --logging-aggregation-interval=interval-5-sec --logging-flow-sampling=1 --logging-metadata=include-all
```

### Default Value

By default, Flow Logs is set to Off when a new VPC network subnet is created.

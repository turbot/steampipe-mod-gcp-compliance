These default usernames and passwords are simple to guess, and most are even published on the Internet.Such default passwords and other security parameters are not permissible per this requirement. This requirement also asks to maintain an inventory of all the systems, configuration/hardening procedures. These procedures need to be followed every time a new system is introduced in the IT infrastructure."

  description = "Similar to requirement 3, in this requirement, you must secure the card data when it is transmitted over an open or public network (e.g. Internet, 802.11, Bluetooth, GSM, CDMA, GPRS). You must know where you are going to send/receive the card data to/from. Majorly, the card data is transmitted to the payment gateway, processor, etc. for processing transactions. Cybercriminals can potentially access cardholder data when itâ€™s transmitted across public networks. Encrypting cardholder data prior to transmitting using a secure version of transmission protocols such as TLS, SSH, etc. can limit the likelihood of such data getting compromised."

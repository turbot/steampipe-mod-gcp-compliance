## Description

It is recommended that the principle of 'Separation of Duties' is enforced while assigning KMS related roles to users.

The built-in/predefined IAM role `Cloud KMS Admin` allows the user/identity to create, delete, and manage service account(s). The built-in/predefined IAM role `Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter` allows the user/identity (with adequate privileges on concerned resources) to encrypt and decrypt data at rest using an encryption key(s).

The built-in/predefined IAM role `Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter` allows the user/identity (with adequate privileges on concerned resources) to encrypt data at rest using an encryption key(s). The built-in/predefined IAM role `Cloud KMS CryptoKey Decrypter` allows the user/identity (with adequate privileges on concerned resources) to decrypt data at rest using an encryption key(s).

No user(s) should have `Cloud KMS Admin` and any of the `Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter`, `Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter`, `Cloud KMS CryptoKey Decrypter` roles assigned at the same time.

## Description

It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network route changes.

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) routes define the paths network traffic takes from a VM instance to another destination. The other destination can be inside the organization VPC network (such as another VM) or outside of it. Every route consists of a destination and a next hop. Traffic whose destination IP is within the destination range is sent to the next hop for delivery.

Monitoring changes to route tables will help ensure that all VPC traffic flows through an expected path.

## Remediation

### From Console

Create the prescribed Log Metric:

1. Go to `Logging/Logs-based Metrics` by visiting [https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics) and click "CREATE METRIC".
2. Click the down arrow symbol on the `Filter Bar` at the rightmost corner and select `Convert to Advanced Filter`
3. Clear any text and add:
```
resource.type="gce_route"
AND (protoPayload.methodName:"compute.routes.delete" OR protoPayload.methodName:"compute.routes.insert")
```
4. Click `Submit Filter`. Display logs appear based on the filter text entered by the user.
5. In the `Metric Editor` menu on the right, fill out the name field. Set `Units` to `1` (default) and `Type` to `Counter`. This ensures that the log metric counts the number of log entries matching the user's advanced logs query.
6. Click `Create Metric`.

Create the prescribed alert policy:

1. Identify the newly created metric under the section User-defined Metrics at [https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics).
2. Click the 3-dot icon in the rightmost column for the new metric and select `Create alert from Metric`. A new page displays.
3. Fill out the alert policy configuration and click `Save`.Choosethealertingthreshold and configuration that makes sense for the user's organization. For example, a threshold of zero(0) for the most recent value ensures that a notification is triggered for every owner change in the project:
```
resource.type="gce_route"
AND (protoPayload.methodName:"compute.routes.delete" OR protoPayload.methodName:"compute.routes.insert")
```
4. Click `Submit Filter`. Display logs appear based on the filter text entered by the user.
5. In the `Metric Editor` menu on the right, fill out the name field. Set `Units` to `1` (default) and `Type` to `Counter`. This ensures that the log metric counts the number of log entries matching the user's advanced logs query.
6. Click `Create Metric`.

Create the prescribed alert policy:

1. Identify the newly created metric under the section `User-defined Metrics` at [https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics).
2. Click the 3-dot icon in the rightmost column for the new metric and select `Create alert from Metric`. A new page displays.
3. Fill out the alert policy configuration and click `Save`.Choosethealertingthreshold and configuration that makes sense for the user's organization. For example, a threshold of zero(0) for the most recent value ensures that a notification is triggered for every owner change in the project:
```bash
Set `Aggregator` to `Count`
Set `Configuration`:
- Condition: above
- Threshold: 0
- For: most recent value
```
4. Configure the desired notifications channels in the section `Notifications`.
5. Name the policy and click `Save`.
